  # Hero Section Design

  This is a code bundle for Hero Section Design. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/UPvpZ2CKUZxcTsLK1zgqDa/Hero-Section-Design.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Building and deploying to Netlify

1. Build the production bundle with `npm run build` (outputs to `dist/`).
2. Install the Netlify CLI if you have not already: `npm install -g netlify-cli`.
3. Authenticate once via `netlify login` and choose/confirm the target site.
4. Deploy the latest build with `netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist`.

Whenever you update the site, repeat the build and deploy commands so the Netlify-hosted version stays in sync.
